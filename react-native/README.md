## React-Native Playground for La Foret

# A Financial Literacy Application for Kids

### *** This project is still in alpha, art and mechanics are expected to continue changing. ***
Screen shot of the homescreen from the development build of the application. All assets generated using OpenAI's Dall-e. App will feature an isometric overworld and a dozen or so 2d educational games developed for young children.

Check out the videos below for quick clips of the app's progress.

1. Overworld map, the hub, most everything is clickable and will lead to a minigame.

2. The 'Money Tree' - In this world, the money does grow on tress, but you'll need to pick it.

3. Making progress on the money tree game. Not a lot changed on the surface, but I had to do quite a bit of coding for this one.
