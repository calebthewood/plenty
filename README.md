# Forest

Welcome to the FOREST, where money CAN grow on trees. Become an earworm(?) and seed your own money FOREST. 

Terrified of investing? Want to get a head start and teach your 3-year old child the basics? 

This mobile/tablet application serves as a complementary platform/service to banks & credit union's digital platforms. It enables these banks/credit unions with the ability to introduce investing as a means to grow money to their clients, especially their underaged ones. Created for the 3 - 6 year old child in mind, this content is also accessible to novice adult investors. Banks / Credit Unions empower their clients to grow wealth, by breaking down basic investing skills through a gamified platform.  

Saving in a low-interest financial environment has not been a viable means of growing wealth, so the go-to adage of "work and save money" has simply not been the best way to build wealth. Investing, once an avenue only for insiders and people with brokers, has opened up via digital platforms and low-cost/no-fee trades, and FOREST goes farther by teaching good investing habits/knowledge starting at a young child's level.  

FOREST is a B-Corp whose mission is to support people, profits, and the planet equally.
